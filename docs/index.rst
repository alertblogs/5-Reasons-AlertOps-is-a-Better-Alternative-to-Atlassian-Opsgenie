5 Reasons AlertOps is a Better Alternative to Atlassian Opsgenie
========
An Opsgenie alternative should empower and enable your team to work more flexibly to achieve goals faster.

Fortunately, many incident management and alert escalation software options are available, and each offers a wide range of capabilities and features designed to help companies limit downtime and outages. Various alerting tools claim to be the best, but the devil is in the details when it comes to choosing a tool that focuses on its core purpose and doesn’t deviate into other areas.

Atlassian recently purchased Opsgenie as an incident response orchestration platform for DevOps and ITOps teams. Like most incident management and alert escalation software, Opsgenie offers a variety of capabilities and features. But what most DevOps and ITOps teams don’t realize is that Opsgenie is basic and rigid and doesn’t offer the flexibility available in other platforms.

When it comes to power and flexibility, AlertOps is by far the best option. In fact, there are many reasons to choose AlertOps over Opsgenie and other incident management and alert escalation software:

1. You can keep key stakeholders up to date throughout a crisis.
====
Lackluster communication is a major problem during network or system outages and other critical incidents. If DevOps and IT Ops team members cannot stay in touch during a crisis, a company risks delayed incident response, which may lead to prolonged downtime and outages.

Ultimately, the right incident management and alert escalation software will make it easy for key stakeholders to communicate with one another at all stages of a crisis. AlertOps enables DevOps and IT Ops team members to send regular, automated updates, to multiple people on multiple teams simultaneously, and through different mediums. The result? Everyone is “in the know” from clients, to response teams, all the way up to the CEO.

2. You can eliminate alert fatigue.
====
Unfortunately, alert fatigue is a common problem for many DevOps and ITOps teams. As these teams are bombarded with alerts, team members may struggle to distinguish critical notifications from others. This sometimes leads team members to overlook certain alerts, or perhaps even worse, ignore all notifications that come their way.

Don’t let alert fatigue get the best of your DevOps or ITOps team. Instead, choose an incident management and alert escalation tool with workflows and smart routing capabilities. By doing so, you can ensure DevOps and ITOps team members only receive the alerts meant for them.

3. You can reap the benefits of on-call scheduling.
====
If a critical incident occurs, it is important to know which DevOps or ITOps team members are available to respond. Otherwise, you risk sending out alerts to team members who are unavailable to resolve an incident, resulting in wasted time and resources.

Thanks to incident management and alert escalation software with on-call scheduling capabilities, you can create centralized on-call schedules. This makes it easy to instantly find out who’s on call and view escalation paths, ensuring available DevOps or ITOps team members are notified about incidents.

4. You can reach multiple teams simultaneously.

Oftentimes, incident management and alert escalation software enables one group of DevOps or ITOps team members to communicate with one another – and that’s all. But what happens if multiple groups of DevOps or ITOps professionals should be involved in incident response? In this scenario, it may be virtually impossible to send the same notification to multiple teams at the same time.

When it comes to incident response, you need incident management and alert escalation software that ensures you can deliver alerts to multiple teams at once or connect directly to team members via a conference bridge. By using incident management and alert escalation software with centralized notification rules, you can ensure simultaneous messaging across multiple groups for faster, more efficient incident response than ever before.

5. You can promote a culture of collaboration.
====
Incident management and alert escalation software may require you to use a standard communication platform for alerts. This probably means DevOps and ITOps team members will need to incorporate a new communication platform into their day-to-day toolchain and learn how to use this platform.

However, incident management and alert escalation software is readily available to help seamlessly integrate into your company’s toolchain. This ensures DevOps or ITOps team members can use HipChat, Slack or any number of other collaboration platforms to remain in contact with one another until an incident is fully resolved.

If you’re looking for an Opsgenie alternative that breaks free of simple use-cases, consider all of the options at your disposal. AlertOps empowers your DevOps and IT Ops teams to implement powerful, user-friendly incident management and alert escalation software. Grab a quick demo today around your use-case!
